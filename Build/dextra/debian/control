Description: A tool for DEX and OAT dumping, decompilation, and fuzzing
 The dextra utility began its life as an alternative to the AOSP's dexdump 
 and dx --dump, both of which are rather basic, and produce copious, but 
 unstructured output. In addition to supporting all their features, it also 
 supports various output modes, specific class, method and field lookup, as 
 well as determining static field values. I later updated it to support ART 
 (which is also one of the reasons why the tool was renamed).
 .
 The dextra tool is provided as one of the free downloads provided for the 
 "Android Internals" book (http://NewAndroidBook.com/). You are welcome to 
 use it even if you don't buy the book (though naturally you're even more 
 welcome to buy the book :-). Its method of operation and a lot more about 
 Dalvik internals is covered in detail, in Chapters 10 and 11. Its latest 
 version, as a tar file with binaries for OS X, Linux/Android x86_64 or
 ARMv7, can always be obtained http://newandroidbook.com/tools/dextra.html
