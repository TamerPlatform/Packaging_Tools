Description: Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)
 MobSF is an intelligent, all-in-one open source mobile application 
 (Android/iOS) automated pen-testing framework capable of performing static
 and dynamic analysis. We've been depending on multiple tools to carry out 
 reversing, decoding, debugging, code review, and pen-test and this process
 requires a lot of effort and time. Mobile Security Framework can be used for
 effective and fast security analysis of Android and iOS Applications. It 
 supports binaries (APK & IPA) and zipped source code.
