Description: Generic Android Deobfuscator
 Simplify uses a virtual machine to execute an app and understand what 
 it does. Then, it applies optimizations to create code that behaves 
 identically but is easier for a human to understand. It is a generic 
 deobfuscator because it doesn't need any special configuration or code 
 for different types of obfuscation.
