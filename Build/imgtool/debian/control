Description: A tool for unpacking/creating Android boot partition images
 The imgtool utility is another one of the tools included in 
 http://newandroidbook.com book related to Boot process. This tool 
 acts like a quick extractor for variosu images and internal formats 
 used by difference boot images. This became more important with the 
 L preview, and Google Glass system images.
 .
 If you need a quick tool to unpack Android images, this is useful. 
 Think of it as the inverse of mkbootimg (from the AOSP), coupled 
 with simg2img (the sparse image extractor). Another bonus feature 
 it provides is unpacking the Linux bzimage kernels.
